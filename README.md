Liner
=====

Liner is a command line editor with history. It was inspired by linenoise;
everything Unix-like is a VT100 (or is trying very hard to be). If your
terminal is not pretending to be a VT100, change it. Liner also support
Windows.

Liner is released under the X11 license (which is similar to the new BSD
license).
